# CARS-TYPE-DASHBOARD (EXCEL)
# üöó Cars Dashboard

A dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard for visualizing and analyzing car data, providing key insights into car specifications, performance, and risk factors.

## üåü Overview

This dashboard is designed to help users quickly understand trends and relationships within a dataset of car information. It uses various charts and metrics to present complex data in an easily digestible format.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic Filtering:** Utilize **Slicers** and **form controls (e.g., dropdowns/spinners)** to filter the data instantly based on criteria like `engine-type`, `make`, `fuel-type`, and `body-style`. *(Note: The image shows filter/slicer-like boxes in the top right.)*
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Instant display of critical metrics:
    * Total Cars
    * Average Price
    * Average Horsepower (HP)
    * Maximum Price
* **Visual Data Analysis:** Includes multiple interactive charts:
    * **Pie Charts:** Displaying `SUM OF RISK-RATE VS DRIVE-WHEELS` and `COUNT OF CARS VS BODY STYLE`.
    * **Line/Area Chart:** Showing the relationship between `CITY MPG VS HIGHWAY MPG`.
    * **Bar/Column Charts:** Illustrating `Risk Rating vs Price`, `AVG HP BASED ON FUEL TYPE AND ENGINE TYPE`, and others.
    * **Doughnut Chart:** Visualizing `AVG PRICE VS BODY-STYLE`.
* **Segmented Views:** Separate sheets organize data based on different analytical focuses (as seen in the sheet tabs):
    * `1 RISK RATE VS DRIVE-WHEEL`
    * `2 CITY MPG VS HIGHWAY MPG`
    * `3 COUNT OF CARS VS BODY STYLE`

## üìä Data Source

The dashboard is built upon a dataset containing various attributes for cars, including:

* Price
* Horsepower (HP)
* Fuel type (e.g., diesel, gas)
* Engine type
* Drive wheels (e.g., rear, front, 4wd)
* Body style (e.g., convertible, hardtop, sedan)
* MPG (City and Highway)
* Risk Rating (presumably calculated based on accident data/insurance risk)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To view and interact with this dashboard, you will need:

* **Microsoft Excel (2010 or newer)** or a compatible spreadsheet application (e.g., WPS Office, as seen in the screenshot) that fully supports Excel formulas, charts, and Slicers.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Download:** Clone this repository or download the `cars_dashboard.xlsx` file.
2.  **Open:** Open the file in Microsoft Excel or compatible software.
3.  **Navigate:** Go to the **`DASHBOARD`** sheet.
4.  **Interact:** Use the **Filter boxes** on the right (e.g., `engine-type`, `make`) to instantly update all charts and KPIs based on your selections.
5.  **Explore:** Navigate to other tabs to view the underlying pivot tables or supporting data used to generate the dashboard.

## üõë Limitations

* The data is static and reflects the dataset at the time of creation. It will not automatically update with real-time car data.
* **Slicer/Filter** functionality may be limited or absent if opened in a non-Microsoft Excel program.
